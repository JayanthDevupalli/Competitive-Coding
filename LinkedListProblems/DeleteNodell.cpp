// 237. Delete Node in a Linked List

// There is a singly-linked list head and we want to delete a node node in it.
// You are given the node to be deleted node. You will not be given access to the first node of head.
// All the values of the linked list are unique, and it is guaranteed that the given node node is not the last node in the linked list.

 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
